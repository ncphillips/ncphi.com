> Self-organizing, nonlinear, feedback systems are inherently unpredictable. They are not controllable. They are understandable only in the most general way. The goal of foreseeing the future exactly and preparing for it perfectly is unrealizable. The idea of making a complex system do just what you want it to do can be achieved only temporarily, at best. We can never fully uderstand our world, not in the way our reductionist science has led us to expect. \[...\] For any objective other than the most trivial, we can't optimize; we don't even know what to optimize. We can't keep track of everything. \[...\] For those who stake their identity on the role ominiscient conqueror, the uncertainity exposed by systems thinking is hard to take. If you cant understand, predict, and control, what is there to do?

The future can't be predicted but it can be envisioned and brought lovingly into being. \[...\] We can't impose our will on a system. We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone.
